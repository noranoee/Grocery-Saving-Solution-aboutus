# Data-Driven Retail Insights (Instacart) — Cost Savings & Revenue Growth
Prototype analytics + recommendation tool that turns grocery-basket data into *actionable retail insights*: product bundles, customer segments, purchase prediction, and *money impact simulations*.

This project is built as a *Python ML pipeline* (Jupyter Notebook + reusable modules) and a *Streamlit web app* that presents insights for shop owners: “If I adopt these insights, how much money do I save or earn, and why?”

## 1) Project Context
We use the *Instacart Online Grocery Basket Analysis* dataset (3M+ orders, 200K+ customers) to study customer behavior, shopping frequency, and product preferences, then translate findings into business actions:
- smart bundling/upselling
- customer segmentation for targeted marketing
- purchase prediction
- revenue/savings simulations
- promotion efficiency (ROI)

Core mining algorithms compared: **Apriori**, **Eclat**, **FP-Growth**, and **UP-Tree** (utility-aware mining to capture *value/profit*, not just frequency).
